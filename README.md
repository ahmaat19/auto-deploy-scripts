# Auto Deploy Script

These scripts will help you to deploy your node.js based project to cloud e.g. <digitalocean.com> within **10 minutes**.

You have two options:

- You can copy and paste `deploy.sh` script into your server e.g. `/root`
- Start from your computer without copying and pasting anything. Update `starter.sh` replace `<host-ip>` to your new Host IP and Run `starter.sh` from your local computer.

If you got a permission error

```shell
chmod +x ./starter.sh
./starter.sh
```

or

```shell
chmod +x ./deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

**NB** during deployment it will ask you a questions please answer all as it's.

Feel free to ask me any help if you need
